**Title:** Developing Self-Supervised Learning Models for Reducing the Dependency on Expert Supervision in Medical Image Analysis

Deep Learning methods are capable of learning highly complex mathematical functions using a large number of
neural-net layers. Therefore, deep learning models require a large amount of data to learn large numbers of
parameters. However, the two main problems encountered in current medical imaging studies with Deep Learning
are: (i) lack of annotated datasets and (ii)imbalanced datasets between labels or classes. While limited labeled
datasets cause overfitting, an imbalanced dataset between positive and negative samples causes an underfitting
problem for deep networks. Thus, deep learning models are challenging to provide high performance in computer
vision problems with insufficient data; medical imaging is one of these areas. The problem of generating largescale and public datasets for medical image analysis is difficult to solve in the short term due to practical difficulties
such as cost, time, patient privacy, and lack of standard data publication procedures. On the other
hand, the problem of an imbalanced dataset can be challenging for generating a large-scale annotated
dataset. Therefore, it is an important field for medical image analysis studies that researchers develop Deep
Learning strategies to overcome these data constraints by reducing the dependence on expert supervision. 
In recent years, self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained remarkable attention against lack of datasets owing to
pretext task and downstream task mechanisms with prior studies. The pretext task is pre-designed as the former task
for learning discriminative visual features on unlabeled data to be used in downstream tasks such as
classification, detection, and segmentation. In addition to providing robust and performance-enhancing solutions in the
lack of labeled data, self-supervised learning methods allow extraction of distinct signals by using labeled and
unlabeled data all together as in an unsupervised manner during the pretext task step. Thus, SSL provides a
solution to the problem of a large amount of unlabeled data, which is the most critical problem in medical image
tasks. However, there is a noticeable lack of self-supervised learning models for medical image analysis
tasks and needs to be improved with further studies. In conclusion, we focus on SSL models to deal with data
limitations and enable automated diagnosis and detection systems at the expert level for clinical usage by reducing
expert demand for medical image tasks.
